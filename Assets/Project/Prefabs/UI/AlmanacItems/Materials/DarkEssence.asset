  description: Highly energetic material. It has very peculiar characteristics that
    make it the only material capable of connecting teleporters. It is impossible
    to obtain it by digging on the asteroid; however, there are some animals that
    are capable of extracting it and that can metabolize it. You can obtain dark
    essence from them.
